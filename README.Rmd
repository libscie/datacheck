The goal of datacheck is to scans datasets for potential sensitive information that could be considered privacy violations according to data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This is a tool to help screen datasets that researchers may want to openly share online. It can also be used as a research tool to scan datasets for potential privacy violations. 

The dataset itself is scanned in the R environment and is not sent to  any remote server; it happens 100% with the package and on the person's device.
